  <h1 id="Greetings">Welcome, This is Varray TV!</h1>
  
  <p>This website explains the creation and Process of our brand: Varray TV. <br>As you scroll down, more and more information that breakdown the brand would be mentioned, <br> and how we concluded with the name and the brand itself.</p>

    <p>First off, let's start with the basics. What our brand is about, The type of people that we want to reach with our content and what we needed to do in order to build this brand. Well, simple answer. First, we needed manpower to actually start this. Our team consists of two people. It was a rough start given that there's only two people in a team.</p>

    <p>We researched everything from how we create a simple brand to how we create aesthetics for it. Well one is for sure since the start, We wanted to focus both on Gaming and Entertainment. With that being said, we also want our audience to be entertained and could use our contents as a temporary escape.</p>

    <p>It was a rough start and a rough ending. Not everything can go smooth but we know that we're doing our best. That's why we want our audience to also learn that from us and from the journey of our brand.</p>

    <p>Here it is! The fun part of creating our brand: The designing part. Well, let's just say it's because it was the easiest part and task to do.</p>

    <p>The design started from nothing. Just a black background and nothing else. Then it all went right since then. We started with how the text would look, then to what ould represent our content and the impact of it. </p>

    <p>The shooting stars represents the impact of our content to our audience, the "Live" button beside the text represents the livestreams that we will do, and below that is our tagline that holds everything together.</p>

    <p> Our Tagline "Sit Back, Relax, and Enjoy the Laugh" is a variation of the popular "Sit Back, Relax, and Enjoy" We thought that it really rolls of the tongue well and since the quote is popular, it would be common for people to hear variations just like ours. </p>
